# Microcontroller-mini-game-Defence-Line
I coded a survival game in C++ on a Mbed LPC1768 microcontroller, where a player needs to fight against enemies to prevent them from breaching through a defence line.

Please open "Microcontroller mini-game Defence Line" presentation for details.

Since this is an assessed university project, I can share the code only by request.
